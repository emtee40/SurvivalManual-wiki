> A MultiTool can be useful in everyday life - not only in survival situations.

### What does it provide

It can provide a lot of tools. There are different options available. It is always a trade-of between weight/size and the amount of tools.
The common available tools in a typical Multi-Tool are:

* Knife
* Can-Opener
* Screw-Driver
* Pliers
* Wire-Cutter
* Wood-Saw
* ...

If you use a Multi-Tool in every-day life, then you know how to use it in a survival situation. The seconds you are faster and the confidence you have in your tool can decide between life and death.

### Which MultiTool

There are a lot of options out there. I really like my [Leatherman OHT](OHTMultiTool).
I am carrying it most of the time when going out.
Basically just leave it at home when I want to go dance and jump around or have to go to a place with security which might have a problem with the tool as it contains a sharp knife.
