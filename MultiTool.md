A Multi-Tool can be useful in everyday life - it can provide:

* Knife
* Can-Opener
* Screw-Driver
* Pliers
* Cutter
* Wood-saw
* ...

If you use it in every-day life, then you know how to use it in a survival situation. The seconds you gain could decide between life and death. 

There are a lot of options out there. I really like my [Leatherman OHT][1]. I am carrying it very often when going outside on a day to day basis. The one-hand aspect is nice and it feels durable. Also I can replace the cable cutter blades. Disclaimer: If you click on this link and buy this tool or something else on amazon in this browser tab you are supporting this app as this is an affiliate link. I will keep the app ad-free otherwise - but some users asked how they can support this work - this would be one way. Otherwise I am planning to put a direct payment option on [my website](http://ligi.de)
