> A Multi-Tool can be useful in everyday life - not only in survival situations.

It can provide a lot of tools. There are different options available. It is always a trade-of between weight/size and the amount of tools.
The common available tools in a typical Multi-Tool are:

* Knife
* Can-Opener
* Screw-Driver
* Pliers
* Wire-Cutter
* Wood-Saw
* ...

If you use a Multi-Tool in every-day life, then you know how to use it in a survival situation. The seconds you are faster and the confidence you have in your tool can decide between life and death.

There are a lot of options out there. I really like my [Leatherman OHT][1]. I am carrying it very often when going outside on a day to day basis. The one-hand aspect is nice and it feels durable. Also I can replace the cable cutter blades.

I will keep the app free and will not disturb you otherwise - but some users asked how they can support this work. This would be one way. Otherwise I am planning to put a direct payment option on [my website](http://ligi.de)
