contributors are coming on board - preparing a credits section!-)

> Collaboration is a wonderful thing. Together we can achieve greater things than alone.

# Indirect contributors

First I want to thank some names that did not directly contribute to this app - but still where really important for it as the project might not have started without them:

* My parents - I would not be alive and the same human without you
* Josha Bach for a wonderful school of thought
* Sadhguru - for opening the gates to inner engineering / joga
* Jah Shaka - for opening gates to spirituality and musical healing
* Vitalik Buterin and Vlad Zamfir for a potentially awesome future fabric and hope
* Linus Torwalds - not sure if more for git or linux
* Edward Snowden - for shining light into darkness 
* Jacque Fresco for wonderful visions of the future
* c-base spacestation - for being an inspirational space
* chaos communication events - for being an inspirational time
* This list is not meant to be complete - just don't want to have it too long so nobody reads it anymore ;-)

# Graphics 

* I am proud to announce [cookicons](https://cookicons.co) promised to create an icon for this app
* The chapter mono-colored icons are the [material icons from google](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons)
* Most graphics embedded in the texts are from the field manual - but I already got contacted by illustrators - we might see more soon here ;-)

# Translators

There are a lot of translators knocking on the door - unfortunately I am not yet ready to take translations. This app has some special challenges regarding translations - you can read more about this [in the translator notes](TranslatorNotes)
