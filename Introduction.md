> This section will give you some information regarding this application. But **if you are in a survival situation right now** - please **skip this** blurb and directly jump to the section that contains the information for your current top most problem/need.

This app is intended to guide you in rough times. But it can also be used for having fun outdoors and teach you things that are useful even outside a survival situation. And the fun part can even be used to train important skills for potential survival situations. Reading is only one part - but practice and understanding are also needed to increase your chances to survive.

The app is based on the FM 3-05.70 Field Manual - but now [it is a wiki](https://github.com/ligi/SurvivalManual/wiki) ( like in wikipedia ) so the content is able to be improved easily. That said - when you see something that can be improved - or if you find something is missing - step up and improve the content!

Also if you are able to illustrate: I am currently adding new sections and am not able to illustrate. E.g. the new section on [Power](Power) could use some images of e.g. wind and water generators. It is important to keep the images small - Ideally they are vector images - but black&white images as the other ones in this app also work. The file-sizes must be small so people do not uninstall their Survival-App to make space ( also temporary and then forget about it ). This app should always be one-digit MegaBytes in size so people can just keep it on their phones without really worrying about it.

There will be updates to content and the app - please [join the BetaTesters](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/org.ligi.survivalmanual) to give feedback and get the newest stuff first.

This app is free and libre software under GPLv3. You can find the source-code [on github](https://github.com/ligi/SurvivalManual) - Pull-Requests are very welcome! Just before doing big changes please contact me so that there is no work in vain.

If you have a question - check out [the FAQ](faq) - perhaps your question is answered there.

Thanks to all people that made this app possible! You can find some of them [in the credits](credits).

That said happy surviving - live long and prosper! With the hope that you never get in such trouble that you really need this guide but had fun preparing for potential situations and learned something.
