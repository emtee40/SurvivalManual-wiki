### Rule of 3

>3 Minutes without air (oxygen) or in icy water

>3 Hours without shelter in a harsh environment (unless in icy water)

>3 Days without water (if sheltered from a harsh environment)

>3 Weeks without food (if you have water and shelter)


### What I do everyday?

>Imagine it is Friday. You woke up a little bit after 10 am and you are starving, so what you do everyday?

* I wake up
* Go use the bathroom (no details right!)
* Clean your teeth
* Take a shower
* Eat a really nice breakfast/lunch
* Have fun (not really but keep thinking)
* Sit on the couch
* Dinner
* Next day, all over again

>In a survival scenario this will give you an idea of what you need to survive. 

### Distillation

Distillation is the process of purifying a liquid. 

### Distill Water

>How do I distill water? 

* First make a fire (see here [how to make a fire] (https://github.com/ligi/SurvivalManual/wiki/Firecraft)
* Find 2 metal containers one to heat the water and the other to collect the vapors
* Place a small container filled with water and heat it up until vapor starts coming out (water evaporates about 100 Celsius / 212 degrees Fahrenheit)
* Place another container above and pay attention, you will see water drops forming on the second container if not place it a little bit more higher until you see them forming (make sure there is no wind). This is called Condensation - condensation occurs when a vapor is cooled down and it is turned into liquid form.
* Collect the water droplets into a bottle or another plastic container and let it cool (do not drink really hot water)
* You will have distilled water it is safer to drink (do not drink only distilled water for prolonged period of time it is harmful)
* You can drink distilled water to help the body absorb toxic substances from the body and eliminate them.
* Note: Using distilled water while fasting may cause a rapid sodium, potassium, chloride, and magnesium loss. 

### Fuel

>In a survival scenario you will need fuel and the nearest gas station will be closed and empty.

>I will talk to you a little about microbiology. Boring right! just give me a few seconds and you will see how cool it is.

>Since you know what is yeast, there is over 1,400 types of yeast and one of them is in the air and they will help you
>make your fuel. 

>This specific type of yeast in a anaerobic environment (no air) survives but to survive it needs food, you might be wondering what food? Sugars, sugars feed the yeast and allows them to survive but with as side-effect (good ones, keep reading) in the process yeast feeds from the sugars creating carbon dioxide and alcohol (ethanol) the one you find in alcoholic beverages. Since your are trying to survive this is will be used for cleaning and disinfecting any small wounds, etc. Do not drink it unless you have mastered how to make drinking alcohol in a survival scenario. 

> Using sugar + water mix 

* Use a large container ideally a bucket with a lid (or something similar). make sure is clean
* Since we you don not have yeast let that mixture in the air for a day or two
* Put the lid back on the bucket and make a tiny hole (the process creates carbon dioxide - try not to smell or have this gas near your sleeping area and keep it in a ventilated area)
* You will start to smell something fermenting (if smells rotten discard it) in a day or two you can perceive a beer kind smell. 
* After a total of 5-7 days take that mixture and use the process of distillation
* Make sure you use a distillation equipment or something appropriate. Remember you are trying to distill fuel (ethanol) which is a colorless, flammable liquid (distilling fuel (ethanol) will be first in gas form and it will ignite in when in contact with any flames)

> Using corn

* In a rag, t-shirt or any permeable fabric put large amount of corn and let it sit in running water for a couple of days until you see the corn to start sprouting (has little roots coming out of them)
* Once it has roots crush your corn and you will have a corn starch. Mix your starch with warm water to form the mash this will turn the starch into sugars (you can then ferment the sugars and follow the same process as making Fuel using sugar + water mix

> Using fruits

* Follow the same process of making Fuel using sugars + water
