> To use the [Apps](Apps) on your phone you need power. Power can also provide you with light and empower you in many other ways. But the grid and outlets might not be available. In the early days of this app, there were a lot of comments claiming that this app is useless, as you will not have power. I disagree, and have created this section to address these concerns.

## Methods to generate power
 
### Solar

There are [Solar USB chargers](SolarUSBCharger). Harvesting the power of the sun is a great and very clean way to generate power. There are only 2 real drawbacks for this kind of power:

* it is not available at night 
* the output depends on the weather

But if it is available, you can use it effortlessly. While you are harnessing the power of the sun, you can engage in other actions, such as obtaining food or building a shelter.

### Bicycle

In contrast to the sun, generating power with your Bicycle is more effort, but it can also be a lot of fun and serve as good exercise. And it might be easily available, as most bikes already have a "generator" installed. Usually this "generator" / dynamo is there to power your lights on the bike. However, it can also charge a phone. You only need a converter to 5V/USB - you can build one yourself or buy one. But be careful here - there are some really bad converters out there. I would recommend building one yourself.

### Wind

Wind-power is also great. It can be available day and night - but you need wind. Also, generators are often bulkier and hard to transport. However, it can be a great option if you are stationary, and are not on the move. It is not particularly  difficult to build a wind-generator. Basically, you just need to get the wind to turn something - use junk and your MultiTool to get the wind to rotate a shaft and attach a motor. A motor is basically the same as a generator - you just need to build some electronics to harvest the power.

### Water

You can also use water to generate power. One option is to use the flow of a river passing by. There you basically do the same as you would with the wind-turbine - in this case, water rather than wind turns the generator. One big advantage of using a river is that you get a steady rotation-speed, and the flow usually does not stop, while the wind might. However, it depends on having access to a river or a dam. Speaking of a dam - you can also build things to direct the water and make the flow faster.

### Heat-Difference

You can also generate power by harnessing heat differentials, e.g. with a fire. There are now turnkey solutions like the [BioLite Wood Burning Campstove with USB](CampStoveUSB) or there are also some fire pots out there with a power USB outlet. Breakthroughs in science and engineering have recently introduced new exciting, portable options. You canalso harvest the power of a fire via steam, as is often done in a large scale today. But on a small scale, this is labor-intensive to use and implement in practice.

### Hand Crank

Using the muscles of your arm is another option. There are small USB cranks to operate by hand, some even [with a light](HandCrankUSB). But be aware that this really binds you to the task, as you cannot do much else while turning the crank. Additionally, I personally find it an exhausting and boring task - I prefer to use the bicycle. However, it is always good to have an array of options, and I own a small crank for emergencies.

### Car

You can also use a car to generate power. A car always comes with a generator - if you drive around the (typically 12V), the battery is charged. You just have to convert the 12V to 5V for the phone. You can really easily build this yourself cheaply e.g. with a LM7805 Voltage Regulator IC or you buy some [car usb-charger](CarUSBCharger). But be aware that you hurt the environment when doing so. This should be the last resort, or used when are capable to around in a car anyway to get from point A to point B.

## Tips & Tricks

### Power-Bank

Get a good power-bank. Often you do not want to use the energy directly while still generating it. Lets take solar - you may charge your power-bank during the day, and may use the power at night. Be aware that the capacity information on these power-banks are often inaccurate or outright lies. Try them out for yourself and measure!

### Stay DC

If possible, stay DC (Direct Current) - if you need to make a DC/AC (Alternating Current) AC/DC roundtrip (e.g. with a power inverter) you lose a lot of energy from having to convert between AC/DC, e.g. in the form of waste heat that is not easily reclaimable. Also, DC is most of the time less dangerous to handle - so it helps you to survive the process of surviving ;-)

### Save Power

You do not have to generate the power you save. A big help in saving power is measuring what device consumes how much energy in which state. For example, your phone consumes a lot more energy when the radios (wifi, cellular, ..) are switched on. Also, the brightness of the display plays a big role in its battery life.
