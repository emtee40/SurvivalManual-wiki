> Properly planning for the possible contingencies that may occur during a mission is a positive step toward being able to cope successfully with the changes in situation. The EPA is a critical document to an individual soldier or to a unit faced with evading enemy forces. First, it is a plan that will provide evaders a starting point to begin operating effectively once evasion has begun. Second, it gives recovery forces the ability to know what the evaders are planning to do, thus making recovery operations easier. A well-thought-out EPA that everyone can understand is an important document to the evader.

> **Note:** Upon deployment, you may carry with you the information compiled in A through E of the SITUATION paragraph **only**.
