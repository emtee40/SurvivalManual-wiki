>The art of Fire making, fire lighting or fire craft is something we need to; eat, sleep, purify liquids, keep us warm at night, actually most of the survival relies in how to make a fire. Knowing how to start one will help you maintain you fed and comfortable at night in cold or really cold climates.


## Fire using Friction

> You have seen in the movies the actor takes 2 pieces of dry wood and start rotating one of the sticks with his palms. 

> Even though this is not the best method it will work while you get supplies along your journey. 

> So how do I use sticks to start a fire?

* First find dry wood/timber (wet wood does not work, if you do not have any option try peeling to the center you might find it dryer and will speed up the process). The more you find during the day the more you will have to last the hole night. 
* Find some thinner, smaller pieces or crush your timber with a rock until it looks like flour but not too much. Look around you might find something similar. The point is to have those pieces hot as fast as you can.  
* Find a flat piece of timber and with a rock make a small hole to hold your stick.
* Place a small amount of your crush timber in the hole enough to fill the hole but not too much. 
* Place a long stick (try to use one straight and with little or with out any branches) in the hole
* Start rotating the stick with your palm from top to bottom while applying pressure
* Continue doing this until you see smoke (don not stop yet)
* Once you see a good amount of smoke take that and dump it into more crush timber, this will make it easier since heat can be transferred faster. SLOWLY blow air using your mouth until you see your ember (glowing hot piece of timber) 
* Protect that ember from the wind with your hand and continue blowing air, you will see a lot of smoke and once you see fire place that into the larger pieces of wood. (Note: do not make the fire too big, make sure you can control the fire or at least make it not bigger than 3 feet high 2 feet wide. if there is no water around have dirt or sand to put it out in case an emergency or if you no longer will be using the fire again. Even though you turn it off some pieces of ember will stay lit until there is no more material to burn, be careful)
