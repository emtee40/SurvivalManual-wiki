There is also an individual survival kit with a general packet and medical packet. The cold, hot, and overwater kits are in canvas carrying bags. These kits are normally stowed in the helicopter's cargo and passenger area.

> An aviator's survival vest (SRU-21P), worn by helicopter crews, also contains survival items.
> 
> U.S. Army aviators flying fixed-wing aircraft equipped with ejection seats use the SRFU-31/P survival vest. The individual survival kits are stowed in the seat pan. Like all other kits, the rigid seat survival kit (RSSK) you use depends on the environment.
>
