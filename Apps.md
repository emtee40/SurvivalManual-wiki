### maps 

Have a solution that can work offline like [osmand](http://osmand.net). Download the data for your area and other areas that might be needed. Also try it out offline - e.g. in flight mode. 

### fdroid

Google play might not work - in [fdroid](http://fdroid.org) you can point to alternative repositories. When using the default repository you can also be pretty sure the app is libre/[FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) - as are all apps mentioned here.  Also learn how to install apps without an appstore.

### Light 

The light app might be one of the most used apps on phones ;-)

### Compass

Direction can be useful - also learn how to read it.

### Games

Have a game app to fight boredom and keep the mind stimulated - I recommend [gobandroid](https://github.com/ligi/gobandroid) to play the ancient game of go which has simple rules but is still immensely deep.

### Pass app

I recommend [PassAndroid](https://github.com/ligi/PassAndroid) - just imagine how sad it would be if you get the ticket to the rescue ship in [esPass](http://espass.it) format and have no way to display ..-)

### Tea app

I recommend the [Material Tea timer](https://github.com/ligi/MaterialTeaTimer). Tea or infusions in general will be a thing in these situations.

### Music

Have a Music app that is not a streaming solution and some uplifting music ( I suggest DUB or reggae - but download whatever works best for you )

### Cryptocurrency 

 A cryptocurrency wallet - fiat money/banks might not work anymore - have a [crypto wallet  like the Bitcoin-Wallet](https://github.com/bitcoin-wallet/bitcoin-wallet). Also transfer a little bit of value on it and learn how to use it.

### Reader

Install some PDF reader - and perhaps download some books or manuals.

### Offline dictionary

Install a offline working dictionary and install the languages that you are most likely to face.
